**Question1**<br>
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well. You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator. <br>
**Example 1:**<br>
Input: x = 4 Output: 2 Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.<br>
**Example 2:**<br>
Input: x = 8 Output: 2 Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.<br>
**Constraints:** 0 <= x <= 231 - 1<br><br>

**Question2**<br>
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.<br>
**Example 1:**<br>
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4] Output: [7,0,8]<br>
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.<br>
**Example 2:**<br>
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0] Output: [0]<br>
**Example 3:**<br>
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9] Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]<br>
**Constraints:** The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].<br>
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.<br>
